# White Stock Sentiment Analysis 

We are White Stock, a Hackathon start up team for the Hack the South 2020! We use some Sentiment Analysis, some fancy maths, and some computer magic we provide meaningful information to plan your next move in the market!

We use the general opinion of the public expressed on social media about companies to predict market trends of stocks in the S&P 100 index.

### How does it work?
#### twitter fetcher
It starts by fetching 100 tweets where a company X is mentioned and formats the tweets into a list of tuples (tweet content, datetime of tweet).
#### Sentiment Analyser
The fetched tweets then go into a sentiment analyser which produces of list of tuples (tweet intensity score, datetime of tweet).

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
